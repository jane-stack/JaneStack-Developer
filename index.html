  <h1>HELLO.</h1>
  <h2>I AM TUYEN</h2>
  <h4>A SOFTWARE ENGINEER STUDENT AT FLATIRON</h5>
  <p>This personal website is to showcase all that I've learned in the prework portion of the Flatiron school software engineering program. The links above doesn't actually work. I added the links to show you the hover effect I've added to the website. Except for the CAPTUREDBYJANE link, you can click on that link if you are intrested in taking a look at some of my photography work! Oh, and the photo to the left is a photo I took of my seven year old daughter.</p>
  <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
  <p>My name is Tuyen, a Software Engineering student at Flatiron school. I've worked as a photographer for about two years while also attending the role as a stay-at-home mom. Orginally from Washington state, my family moved to Colorado for my husband's career back in 2017. Now that his career is considered to be stable, it is time I work on a career of my own. My goal after completeing this program is to secure a position as a front end developer. I have no previous experience in programming but I will work as hard as it takes!</p>
